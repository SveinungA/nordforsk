if(!require("codebook")){install.packages("codebook");  library(codebook)}

dn_no <-  read_sav('C:\\Users/svein/Documents/nordforskdata/Norwegian Citizen Panel wave 1-15 - NO.sav')
dn_no <- dn_no %>% select(starts_with('r15pad_terror'), responseid, r15P1, r15P4_2, r15P5_1, r14pk8_1, r15Weight1) %>% filter(!is.na(r15pad_terror1_ran1))
